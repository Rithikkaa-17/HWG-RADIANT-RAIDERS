# HWG-RADIANT-RAIDERS
Hello everyone! Our team Radiant-Riders have successfully done this project on Smart Bio-Adhesive MXene Hydrogel for Implant Integration as part of our participation for HACK WITH GUJARAT(HWG).This projects has it's Machine Learning Model trained and fine tuned from datasets(from Kaggle) and self made datasets from a collection of datasets which have been taken from Pubnet,etc. With this we can get to quicker Idea and how our project stands out (well offcourse it can be done when it comes in a business perspective) and can be accessed from your own device.

AI-Integrated Smart Bio-Adhesive MXene Hydrogel for Implant Integration
By Team Radiant Raiders

🚀 Project Description
Our project aims to tackle implant-related complications such as infection, poor biocompatibility and slow healing. By integrating MXene-Gelatin hydrogels, AI-driven material optimization and electrospinning-based coating techniques, we offer a next-gen solution for smarter, infection-resistant medical implants.

🏥 Problem Statement
5–10% of implants fail due to infection and poor integration.

Current coatings lack conductivity and bioactivity.

Result: Painful revision surgeries, high costs and long recovery.

💡 Our Solution
MXene-Gelatin Hydrogel: Conductive, bioactive and antimicrobial.

AI Optimization: Tunes biocompatibility, conductivity and stability.

Electrospinning Coating: Uniform nanoscale bio-layer for superior adhesion and healing.

🧰 Tech Stack
Python (for AI model and optimization)

Jupyter Notebook (Radiant_Riders.ipynb, Radiant_Riders_finalmodel_and_webapp.ipynb)

Flask (for web app deployment)

HTML/CSS (frontend integration)

MXene-Gelatin Bio-coating (lab-based)

🛠 How to Setup and Run the Final Web Application
📥 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Rithikkaa-17/HWG-RADIANT-RAIDERS.git
cd HWG-RADIANT-RAIDERS

📦 2. Unzip the Web App Folder
Unzip FINAL WEB APPLICATION.zip:
unzip FINAL\ WEB\ APPLICATION.zip
cd FINAL\ WEB\ APPLICATION

📋 3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is missing, install typical Flask dependencies manually:
pip install flask pandas scikit-learn numpy

🧪 4. Run the Application
python app.py
You will see something like:
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Open the URL in your browser to access the Smart Hydrogel Implant WebApp.
